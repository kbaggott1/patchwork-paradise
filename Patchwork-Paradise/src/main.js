 *
 * Patchwork Paradise is a game as much about exploration as it is about farming. Allow yourself to enjoy
 * the experience of growing a large variety of crops as well as exploring the nearby town of patchwork 
 * paradise. Upgrade your farm to have more farmable land and speak with the people of the town, go on quests
 * for them and get rewarded.
